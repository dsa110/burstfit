## How to contribute to Burstfit

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/thepetabyteproject/burstfit/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/thepetabyteproject/burstfit/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the [bug report template](https://github.com/thepetabyteproject/burstfit/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change using the [feature request tempelate](https://github.com/thepetabyteproject/burstfit/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and start writing code.

* Make sure you write appropriate documentation (we use Google Docstrings) and corresponding tests (using pytest).
